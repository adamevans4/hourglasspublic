This project was a proof-of-concept.
There is no active website or database. You are free to add your own in the Mauiprogram.cs file. By default
a local db connection is used. This local db does not work with the Visual Studio 2022 software emulators.
As a result the Maui project does not work currently. You are able to run locally as a website however,
which demonstrates the same functionality.
